"""
Central seed orchestration for the L&T Neural Grid DERMS platform.

Calling ``await seed_all(db)`` is idempotent — every individual seed function
checks whether its records already exist before inserting.

Typical usage (from a startup hook or CLI):

    async with AsyncSessionLocal() as db:
        await seed_all(db)
        await db.commit()
